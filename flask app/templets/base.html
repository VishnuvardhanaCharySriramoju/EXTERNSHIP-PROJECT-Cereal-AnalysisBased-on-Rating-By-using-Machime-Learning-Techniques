    <p> A customer wants to buy some food items with high dietary benefits.It is so difficult to choose an item.Usually a customer expects to consume dietary cereals with high proteins,fiber and low sugars,fats.Predicting a brand with high dietary cereals became a big issue.</p>
        <p> we use machine learning algorithms to predict the food with high beneficiary diety.The model can pedict the rating of the food more accurate by giving the inputs which are the cereals and ingredients present in the food. Thus a customer can get high dietary food by the rating of the food given to it from the cereals and ingredients present. The rating is predicted using the nerual network model. The rating of the food given to it from the cereals and ingredients present. The rating is predicted using the neural network model.</p></center>
